# Horiseon_challenge_1

## Description
In this week challenge #1, as a beginner web developer I was tasked to refactor the codebase that follows accessibility standards to enable accessibility for anyone. Nowadays, accessibility has been one of the top consideration for various industries because it ensures people with disabilities can easily access the website using assistive technologies. In addition, accessibility is important for businesses because it allows an easy access to a website, and it helps avoid litigation.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code

THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the icon and image elements

THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes

THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Technologies
The technologies I used in this challenge includes:
1. HTML: template HTML was given to refactor the codebase of a Marketing Agency website called Horiseon.
2. CSS: template CSS was given to make necessary changes.
3. Github: Gibhub was used to create a repository which includes the links to the projects, assets folder, and the README file.
4. Giblab: Giblab was used to clone the project to out laptop.

## Installation
To install the challenge #1 project, create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

## Deployment
1. When you're ready to deploy, use the "git add", "git commit", and "git push" commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

2. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

3. On the Settings page, select Pages on the left side of the page. On the GitHub Pages screen, choose `main` in the dropdown under Branch. Click the Save button.

4. Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.
