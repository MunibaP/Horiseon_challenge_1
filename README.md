# Horiseon_challenge_1

## Description
In this week challenge #1, as a beginner web developer I was tasked to refactor the codebase that follows accessibility standards to enable accessibility for anyone. Nowadays, accessibility has been one of the top consideration for various industries because it ensure people with disabilities can easily access the website using assistive technologies. In addition, accessibility is important for businesses because it allows an easy access to a website, and it helps avoid litigation.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code

THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the icon and image elements

THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes

THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Technologies
The technologies I used in this challenge includes:
1. HTML: template HTML was given to refactor the codebase of a Marketing Agency website called Horiseon.
2. CSS: template CSS was given to make necessary changes.
3. Github: Gibhub was used to create a repository which includes the links to the projects, assets folder, and the README file.
4. Giblab: Giblab was used to clone the project to our laptop.

## Installation

To install the challenge #1 project, first create a new repository in your GitHub account, and then clone this repository to your local computer.

To clone: git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git

## Deployment

1. Deploy your code by running "git add", "git commit", and "git push" in your local repository.

2. Visit your GitHub repository online, click 'Settings', and then select 'Pages' on the left.

3. In GitHub Pages, set the 'main' branch as the source and click 'Save'.

4. Access your live site at <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name>. For example, if your username is "lernantino" and your repo is "css-demo-site", the URL is <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.
